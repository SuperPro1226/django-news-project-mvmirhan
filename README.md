# Plus Resources: Django Project Starter

<!-- Starter code for the Plus Django project. -->


1. Link to Heroku: 
    This doesn't work even though my Heroku dashboard indicated that I deployed a successful build. I have provided a screenshot 

2. Features implemented. Please see accompanying screenshots in the z_project_screenshots folder

    Part 1          
    a. Ordered the stories by date. Also removed the images from "All Stories" when viewed from the index page. But the images are still visible when viewed from the stroy detailed page.
    b. Styled the form to add story
    c. Added a field to input image URL

    Part 2.1
    Functional login and logout buttons, located on the header on the navigation section of each page
    
    Part 2.2         
    Configured a page to view logged in author's user profile. 
    I don't think my configuration here is complete. Seems not to work when other user is logged in. Sorry :(
    
    Part 2.3         
    Configured a page to create new account. Navigation link provided from home/index page
   
    Part 2.4          
    Unable to configure this feature. Sorry :(
    
    Part 2.5       
    1. Header navigation section would only show the "create new story" when a user is logged in
    2. Header navigation section would only show the "create new account" when no user is logged in

    Additional Features
    Unfortunately, I was not able to configure these additional features. Sorry :(
